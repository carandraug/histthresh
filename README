-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HistThresh toolbox contains selected histogram-based thresholding
algorithms for MATLAB. The toolbox has been tested with MATLAB 6.5
(R13), but it may work with some older versions of MATLAB as well.


CURRENT VERSION
---------------

v1.02 (2 Nov 2004)
- minor update: fixed the perpetual loop bug in th_minimum.m and
  th_intermodes.m


INSTALLATION
------------

Extract the contents of the zip file "HistThresh.zip" into a directory
from which MATLAB can find the m-files.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

The thresholding algorithms are named with the prefix "th_". For
example, "th_minimum.m" is the function for the algorithm by Prewitt
and Mendelsohn that chooses the threshold to be in the valley of a
bimodal histogram. The threshold for an 8-bit image can be found by
typing "T = th_minimum(I)". Further help can be obtained by typing
"help <m-file>" in MATLAB, where "<m-file>" is replaced by the name of
an m-file.
